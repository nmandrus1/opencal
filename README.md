# OpenCal

OpenCal is a collaborative, open-source calendar where a group of
friends, teammates, co-workers, classmates can post, view, and manage
relevant events in a server. Classmates in a large class can post study
sessions, homework, lab dates, lecture times in a crowdsourced way. At a
glance, you will be able to see when and where these events are
happening, as well as have the ability to quickly filter only the events
relevant to you. In the future, we can look into hosting our own calendar
servers such that others can use them conveniently, in much the same way
as Discord. We also see possible integration into Submitty, LMS,
or a myriad of other classroom-centric softwares.
